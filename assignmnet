1. find all the unique triplets such that sum of all the three elements [x, y, z (x ≤ y ≤ z)] equal to a specified number.
 Sample array: [1, -2, 0, 5, -1, -4]
 Target value: 2
2. find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence from a given unsorted array of integers.
 Sample array: [49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5]
 The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], therefore the program will return its length 5
3. Write a Java program to associate the specified value with the specified key in a Tree Map
4. Write a Java program to convert a Priority Queue elements to a string representation
5. Write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using Quick sort Algorithm
Quick sort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined
